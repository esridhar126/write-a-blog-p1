## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. How much Job Satisfaction could be affected based on Job role?
2.  How Age plays an major role on DailyRate of the employee?
3. How Monthly income was changing with respect to Education of the Employee?
4. Finally I did a small prediction on Monthly rate based on following features, Education, Education field, Gender, age, No of companies worked, PercentSalaryHike, YearsInCurrentRole etc... using ML techniques( i gave a small try)

The files are related to analytics and i download it from Kaggle, it is for practising purpose only.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

HR analytics_blog_work.ipynb: notebook including pythons scripts.
README.md: this file
HR1.csv: dataset of HR analysis of IBM.
HR.csv: schema of the dataset.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available: https://medium.com/@esridhar59/skill-vs-mindset-solving-the-bigger-challenge-238eadb9b921

The people who are working in any company need a job satisfaction, less pressure, marital status, education, monthly income ..., By taking this as my important parameters, i generate a basic basic business questions and get some solutions. 
Basically if the employee has satisfied with his/her job, then he/she doesnot care about money and also vice versa, if the employee cares about money/income and all means, he won't get any job satisfaction at any cost. 

This is what i try to explain with this project.
Hope everyone will like it, commit anything if there is any changes.
